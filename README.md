# welcome to pokedb
This is a project by me, Liam!

Purpose: 
- To practice database usage
- Have a local version of a pokemon database (so I don't need internet!)
- For my own interest

Hopeful End Goals:
- Full documentation of abilities, moves, pokemon, stats
- Some compatibility  between the aforementioned categories and searching programs
- Held item support, possibly
- A teambuilder / pseudo-PokePC support?
